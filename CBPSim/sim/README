DOWNLOAD:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To run the profiler, please download the CBP frame at:
http://www.jilp.org/cbp2014/framework.html

There are basic instructions for download on this site.

Make sure to replace the main.cc in the sim folder with the main.cc program provided. Also, include the profiler.h file.

NOTE:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The profiler is a C++ class located in profiler.h. An instance of the class is created in main.cc. The methods used in main.cc should remain
in their current order. The profiler will generate many files that contain information on the trace that was run with the profiler. These files
include:

1_raw_stats.txt
2_reduced_dead.txt
3_reduced_glacial.txt
4_dead.txt
5_glacial.txt
6_top_ten_branches.txt
7_branch_targets.txt
8_call_history.txt
9_branch_stats.txt
10_matches.txt
11_loops.txt
12_reduced_loops.txt
13_rets_per_call_history.txt

Some of these files are set to only print out the first hundred values of the history. You can change this HISTORY_SIZE.

Also, there is some verification in the profiler. It tracks many of the counts to ensure everything is adding up. You can check it out
under write_stats method.

RUNNING THE PROFILER:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
./predictor ../traces/SHORT-INT-1.cbp4.gz

All the traces are located in the trace directory.
